            Hi!
            <br>
            <br> My name is Elena and I am a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder.
                I'm from Palos Verdes, California, and while I love Colorado, SoCal will always be my home.

                Being active and adventurous defines my life, whether I'm recreationally playing tennis or hiking along the Palos Verdes cliffs.
                Though I have never been a runner, I recently began running consistently and am so proud that I ran my first marathon in January of this year!

        <p>Building my own website from scratch has been a goal of mine for some time. My creating this page leverages my skills and knowledge to showcase a little bit more about myself.
        <br>
        <br>
        This site will be an indefinite work in progress; I'm teaching myself new things and having fun with this project.

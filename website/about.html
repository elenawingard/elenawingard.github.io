        <p>Hi! My name is Elena and I am a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder.
                I'm from Palos Verdes, California, and while I love Colorado, SoCal will always be my home.

                Being active and adventurous defines my life, whether I'm recreationally playing tennis or hiking along the Palos Verdes cliffs.
                Though I have never been a runner, I recently began running consistently and am so proud that I ran my first marathon in January of this year!
